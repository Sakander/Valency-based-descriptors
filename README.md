# Valency-based-descriptors
Computing valency related graph-theoretic molecular descriptors of general graphs

Let G be a graph for which you would like to compute a valency descriptor.

Step 1. Draw G on newGraph and check adjacency matrix as an invariant by going to "Invariants" tab to "Select Invariant".

Copy the adjacency matrix by right clicking on the matrix.

Step 2. Paste the matrix and order of G in the Valency-descriptors.m file in B and n resepctively.

Run the ValencyDescriptors.m file to obtain your result.
